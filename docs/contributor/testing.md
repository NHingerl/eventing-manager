# Testing

This document provides an overview of the testing activities used in this project.

## Testing Levels

| Test suite | Testing level | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unit       | Unit          | This test suite tests the units in isolation. It assesses the implementation correctness of the unit's business logic.                                                                              |
| Env-tests  | Integration   | This test suite tests the behavior of Eventing Manager in integration with a Kubernetes API server replaced with a test double. It assesses the integration correctness of Eventing Manager. |
| E2E        | Acceptance    | This test suite tests the usability scenarios of Eventing Manager in a cluster. It assesses the functional correctness of Eventing Manager.                                                   |

> **NOTE:** The validation and defaulting rules are tested within the integration tests.

### Unit Tests and Env-Tests

To run the unit and integration tests, the following command must be executed. If necessary, the needed binaries for the integration tests are downloaded to `./bin`.
Further information about integration tests can be found in the [Kubebuilder book](https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/envtest.html).

   ```sh
   make test-only
   ```

If changes to the source code were made, or if this is your first time to execute the tests, the following command ensures that all necessary tooling is executed before running the unit and integration tests:

   ```sh
   make test
   ```

### E2E Tests

Because E2E tests need a Kubernetes cluster to run on, they are separate from the remaining tests.

1. Ensure you have the Kubecontext pointing to an existing Kubernetes cluster and Eventing Manager has been deployed.

   > Note: Creating Eventing custom resource (CR) is optional. If Eventing CR already exists, the test updates the CR to meet the requirements of the test.

2. Export the following ENV variables.

   ```sh
   export BACKEND_TYPE="NATS"         # if using NATS Backend
   export BACKEND_TYPE="EventMesh"    # if using EventMesh Backend
   ```

2. Execute the whole E2E test suite.

   ```sh
   make e2e
   ```

The E2E test consists of four consecutive steps. If desired, you can run them individually. For more information, read the [E2E documentation](https://github.com/kyma-project/eventing-manager/blob/main/hack/e2e/README.md).

## CI/CD

This project uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) as part of the development cycle.
The aim is to verify the functional correctness of Eventing Manager.

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions reside [within this module repository](https://github.com/kyma-project/eventing-manager/tree/main/.github/workflows).

The [Actions overview](https://github.com/kyma-project/eventing-manager/actions/) shows all the existing workflows and their execution details. Here, you can also trigger a re-run of an action.
